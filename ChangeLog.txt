1.3
=======
- Fixed bug reading buffer when read() operations don't return all the available bytes just because they
  are not ready (e.g. a pipe).
- Added to MarkupParser the possibility to split Text nodes (call several Text events in sequence).


1.2
=======
- Added event-based tracing atto handlers.
- Added Object-based tracing event system.


1.1
=======
- Added new events to handlers for automatically balancing tags, by creating synthetic closing elements.
- Added new "noUnbalancedCloseElements" restriction to DocumentRestrictions. This allows unbalanced
  open tags, but not unbalanced close tags (as happens in HTML).


1.0
=======

- First release of attoparser
