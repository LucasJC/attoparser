TODO
====
- Move block/node selection to attoparser
- Simplify selected/non-selected interfaces --> could be an optional interface extension of IMarkupHandler?
- Could the optional interface thing also be used for setParseStatus?
- Should AbstractMarkupHandler have a constructor with a delegate IMarkupHandler, getDelegateHandler() and an implementation of setParseStatus?
- Now the minimizer can know whether we are in XML or HTML mode... should it be generalized?
- Auto-open?
